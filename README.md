# Voice-Analyzer-Using-matlab
The Voice Analyzer Using MATLAB is a user-friendly project designed to analyze and process audio recordings of human voices. It offers various essential features, such as pitch, intensity, formant analysis, and spectrogram generation, making it a valuable tool for speech pathology, linguistics, and vocal performance evaluation.
The project provides an intuitive interface for importing audio files, visualizing audio waveforms, and extracting key features for analysis. Leveraging MATLAB's powerful signal processing and data analysis capabilities, the Voice Analyzer accurately estimates fundamental frequency, intensity, and identifies resonant frequencies (formants) in the voice.

Users can explore statistical summaries and contour plots of the fundamental frequency throughout the recording. Additionally, the project enables exporting analyzed data, graphs, and summary reports for documentation and further analysis.

To use the Voice Analyzer, users simply load an audio file, select desired analysis options, and visualize the results using interactive graphs and plots. The project's modular structure allows easy integration of new features and contributions.
